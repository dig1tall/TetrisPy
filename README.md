# 🎮 TetrisPy

A modern implementation of the classic **Tetris** game written in **Python** using **Pygame**.

This project was originally developed as a **coursework in C**, and later fully rewritten in Python as a **pet project**
with a focus on **object-oriented programming, clean architecture, and modular design**.

## Data Storage

* `scores/scores.csv` — stores player scores
* `scores/champion.dat` — stores global best player (binary format)

---

## Architecture

The project follows a modular OOP design:

* `engine.py` — main game loop and logic
* `board.py` — grid and collision system
* `piece.py` — tetromino behavior
* `renderer.py` — rendering and UI
* `score_manager.py` — local data storage system
* `config.py` — global constants
* `config.py` — shared helper functions and color mapping
